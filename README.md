# Custom-Memory-Allocator
This repository contains a simple, educational block-based memory allocator implemented in C. The allocator manages a fixed-size memory space, dividing it into blocks with headers to track allocation status and block size. It supports basic dynamic memory allocation and operations, as well as a function to display the current memory layout.
